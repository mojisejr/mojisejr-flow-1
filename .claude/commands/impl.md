# impl

Implementation Workflow - Execute GitHub issue implementation based on current mode.

## Usage

```
/impl [issue-number] [optional message]
```

## Examples

```bash
/impl 123                    # Implement issue #123
/impl 123 with extra context # Implement with additional context
/impl 456                    # Implement issue #456
```

## Implementation

### Pre-Implementation Validation

1. **Setup .tmp folder**: `mkdir -p .tmp && echo ".tmp/" >> .gitignore`

2. **Check Dependencies**:
   - Validate GitHub CLI (`gh`) availability
   - Verify Git tools are available

3. **Validate Issue**:
   - Check issue exists and is open
   - Verify issue has `task` label
   - Extract issue title and metadata to `.tmp/issue-details.md`

4. **Validate Environment**:
   - Ensure clean git working directory
   - Verify we're in a git repository

5. **Cleanup temporary files**: `rm .tmp/issue-details.md` (only if no other temp files exist)

### Implementation Steps

1. **Sync Staging Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout staging
   git pull origin staging
   ```

2. **Create Feature Branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/task-[issue-number]-[description]
   ```
   - Extract description from issue title
   - Use naming convention: `feature/task-{issue}-{description}`

3. **Step 0: Write Tests First (Red Phase)** ⚠️ MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   # Create centralized test directory structure (if doesn't exist)
   mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,fixtures,helpers}

   # Create test files BEFORE implementing code in tests/ directory ONLY
   # Tests should fail initially (Red phase)
   [test command]
   # Expected: Tests fail (no implementation yet)
   ```
   - **Create test directory structure**: Ensure `tests/` directory with subdirectories exists
   - **Write tests ONLY in tests/ directory**: Never create test files in source directories
   - Write comprehensive unit tests in `tests/unit/` for the new functionality
   - Write integration tests in `tests/integration/` for API endpoints or service integrations
   - Place test data and utilities in `tests/fixtures/` and `tests/helpers/`
   - Tests document the expected behavior before code exists
   - This ensures Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflow with centralized organization

4. **Mode-Specific Execution**:

   **MANUAL Mode**:
   - Provide detailed implementation guidance
   - Show step-by-step workflow instructions
   - Include TDD requirements
   - Include validation requirements
   - Display commit message format
   - Provide next steps for human developer

   **COPILOT Mode**:
   - Trigger automatic implementation
   - Handle all validation steps
   - Enforce TDD workflow
   - Create commit with proper format
   - Push branch and create PR

## Validation Requirements (100% required):
   ```bash
   ✅ Test must be written BEFORE code implementation (Red Phase)
   ✅ Test files must be created in tests/ directory ONLY (Centralized organization)
   ✅ Test coverage must be comprehensive for new/modified code
   ✅ Tests must PASS (Green Phase complete)
   [build command]     # Build validation (e.g., npm run build, cargo build --release)
   [lint command]      # Lint validation (e.g., npm run lint, cargo clippy -- -D warnings)
   [typecheck command] # Type check validation (e.g., tsc --noEmit, cargo check)
   [format command]    # Format validation (e.g., prettier --check, cargo fmt -- --check)
   [test command]      # Test validation (MANDATORY)
   ```

## 🔴🟢🔵 Red-Green-Refactor Cycle (TDD)

The Red-Green-Refactor cycle is the core of Test-Driven Development:

### 🔴 Red Phase (Tests First)
- **Create test directory structure**: `mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,fixtures,helpers}`
- **Write failing tests in tests/ directory ONLY** for the functionality you want to implement
- Tests document the expected behavior
- Run tests: `[test command]` → tests FAIL (because code doesn't exist yet)
- **NEVER** create test files outside `tests/` directory

### 🟢 Green Phase (Minimal Implementation)
- **Write minimal code** to make the failing tests pass
- Don't implement extra features yet
- Focus only on passing the tests you wrote
- Run tests: `[test command]` → tests PASS

### 🔵 Refactor Phase (Improve Code)
- **Refactor the code** for clarity, performance, and maintainability
- Keep tests passing while improving code quality
- Run tests: `[test command]` → tests still PASS
- Run linter: `[lint command]` → zero warnings/errors
- Run formatter: `[format command]` → consistent style

### Complete TDD Workflow Example
```bash
# Step 1: RED - Create failing tests in centralized tests/ directory
mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,fixtures,helpers}
# Write test file in tests/unit/ or tests/integration/ following project conventions
[test command]                              # → FAILS (no implementation)

# Step 2: GREEN - Implement minimal code
# Write code to make tests pass
[test command]                              # → PASSES
[build command]                             # → Success

# Step 3: REFACTOR - Improve code quality
# Improve implementation while keeping tests passing
[lint command]                              # → Zero warnings
[format command]                            # → Formatted
[test command]                              # → Still PASSES

# Final validation
[build command]                             # ✅ 100% SUCCESS
[lint command]                              # ✅ 100% SUCCESS
[test command]                              # ✅ 100% SUCCESS
# All tests located in centralized tests/ directory ✅
```

## Commit Format

5. **Commit Format**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: [feature description]

   - Address #[issue-number]: [task title]
   - Test-first implemented: Tests written before code implementation in tests/ directory
   - Centralized test organization: All tests in tests/ directory with proper structure
   - Red-Green-Refactor cycle followed (Red → Green → Refactor)
   - Build validation: 100% PASS ([build command])
   - Lint validation: 100% PASS ([lint command])
   - Type validation: 100% PASS ([typecheck command])
   - Format validation: 100% PASS ([format command])

## Mode-Specific Behavior

### MANUAL Mode

**Output Includes**:
- Task information (issue, title, branch)
- Implementation steps checklist
- TDD requirements (Red-Green-Refactor)
- Validation requirements
- Commit message template
- Next steps for human developer

**Human Developer Responsibilities**:
- Create test directory structure: `mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,fixtures,helpers}`
- Write tests FIRST in tests/ directory ONLY (Red phase)
- Execute implementation according to task requirements
- Run all validations before committing
- Use proper commit format
- Push branch and create PR with `/pr`

### COPILOT Mode

**Automatic Execution**:
- Create test directory structure: `mkdir -p tests/{unit,integration,fixtures,helpers}`
- Complete TDD workflow (tests first in tests/ directory!)
- Enforce centralized test organization
- All validation steps
- Proper commit formatting
- Branch creation and push
- PR creation via `/pr`

## Error Handling

- **Issue not found**: Clear error with issue number
- **Invalid environment**: Git status and directory checks
- **Validation failures**: Stop workflow and report errors
- **TDD violations**: Error if tests not written first or not in tests/ directory
- **Test directory violations**: Error if test files created outside tests/ directory
- **Mode-specific**: Provide appropriate guidance per mode

## Integration

- **Before**: Use `/plan [task]` to create task issues
- **After**: Use `/pr [feedback]` to create pull request
- **Mode**: Use `/mode [manual|copilot]` to set execution mode
- **Context**: Use `/fcs [topic]` for context discussions

## Files

- Feature branches: `feature/task-{issue}-{description}`
- `.claude/current_mode` - Determines execution behavior
- GitHub Issues - Task definitions and requirements

## Notes

- Always works from **staging** branch as base (never from main)
- Feature branch naming is strictly enforced
- 100% validation is mandatory before commits
- **Test-Driven Development is MANDATORY** - Tests must be written before code in tests/ directory
- **Centralized test organization is ENFORCED** - All tests must be in tests/ directory structure
- Mode affects who performs implementation steps
- **PR always goes to staging** - developer handles staging → main merge
- Commands adapt to project type (Node.js, Rust, Python, etc.)
